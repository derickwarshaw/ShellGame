Problem: Randomly pick one of three shells to hold a stone and ask the user to guess which shell holds the stone.  If the user is correct, they win $1;  if they are wrong, they owe $2.
         Run the game 5 times and display the number of wins and losses each time the game is run, and the total dollar value won/lost from the 5 runs.
Inputs: user selection
Outputs: outcome of whether they picked the right shell or not, number of wins, number of losses, total value won/lost from 5 runs
Formulas: none

start processing
SET shell equal to zero
SET game equal to one

	LOOP as long as the shell the user selected was less than one or greater than three
		DISPLAY error message
		INPUT the shell the user thinks has the stone under it
	END-LOOP
	IF the shell the user selects is equal to the randomly hidden stone
		DISPLAY congratulations to the user for picking the correct shell
		add one to game
		add one to wins

	IF the shell the user selects is not equal to the randomly hidden stone
		DISPLAY message telling the user they picked the wrong shell
		add one to game
